# Comprehensive VSM Guide

An in-depth guide to the VSM architecture, framework, and resulting patterns

## Overview

This guide gives a detailed overview of the VSM architecture for iOS and takes the reader through the familiar journey of interpreting requirements for a new feature, developing a technical design, implementing the feature, and validating that the feature behaves according to the requirements.

This guide assumes that the reader is familiar with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) (or [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit)), [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine), and [Swift Concurrency](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html).
