# Comprehensive Guide

An in-depth guide to the VSM architecture, framework, and resulting patterns

## Overview

After a deep dive into the VSM architecture theory, this guide takes the reader through the familiar journey of gathering requirements for a new feature, assessing and internalizing the requirements, developing a technical design, implementing the feature, and validating that the feature behaves according to the requirements.
