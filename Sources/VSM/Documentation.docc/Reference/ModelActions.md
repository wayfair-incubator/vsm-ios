Actions are responsible for progressing the "State Journey" of the feature. They need to be flexible to account for any type of functionality. The VSM framework supports a handful of Action types within its ``StateContainer/observe(_:)-1uta3`` overloads. This article covers each one and gives examples of where they each are appropriately used.
